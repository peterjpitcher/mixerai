# MixerAI Project Handover

## Current Status

The project is a Next.js application with Supabase integration, focusing on brand management and user roles. We've been working on fixing database schema issues and improving the authentication flow.

## Recent Changes Made

### Database Schema Updates
1. Created new migrations to fix schema conflicts:
   - `20240408000000_drop_views.sql`: Drops all views and tables to ensure clean slate
   - `20240408000000_fix_user_roles_schema.sql`: Sets up the correct schema structure
   - `20240408000001_setup_roles_schema.sql`: Creates tables and views in the correct order

### Schema Structure
- Created `user_roles_table` as the base table for user roles
- Created `user_brand_access` table for managing brand access permissions
- Created views:
  - `user_roles`: View over `user_roles_table`
  - `user_permissions_view`: Combines user roles and brand access information

### Security
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Created policies for:
  - User role management
  - Brand access control
  - Storage access for brand logos

## Known Issues

1. Database Migration Issues:
   - Current error: "column 'access_level' does not exist" in storage policies
   - Need to ensure storage policies are created after all tables and columns exist

2. Schema Conflicts:
   - Multiple migrations trying to create similar objects
   - Need to consolidate migrations to prevent conflicts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix storage policies in migrations:
   ```sql
   -- Update storage policies to use correct column names
   CREATE POLICY "Brand owners can update their logos"
   ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
   USING (
       bucket_id = 'brand-logos'
       AND (
           EXISTS (
               SELECT 1 FROM user_roles_table
               WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
               AND role_name = 'super_admin'
           )
           OR
           EXISTS (
               SELECT 1 FROM user_brand_access
               WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
               AND access_level = 'owner'
               AND brand_id = (SELECT id FROM brands WHERE name = SPLIT_PART(name, '/', 2))
           )
       )
   );
   ```

2. Consolidate Migrations:
   - Review and combine overlapping migrations
   - Ensure correct order of operations (tables → views → policies)
   - Remove duplicate object creation attempts

### Future Improvements
1. Database Structure:
   - Consider adding indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Add constraints for valid access levels and role names
   - Add cascade delete options where appropriate

2. Security:
   - Review and tighten RLS policies
   - Add input validation for role names and permissions
   - Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

3. Application Features:
   - Complete brand creation flow
   - Implement role-based access control in the UI
   - Add user invitation system
   - Implement brand logo upload functionality

## Environment Setup

The application runs on:
- Next.js 14.0.3
- Local development server: http://localhost:3001 (Port 3000 was in use)
- Environment variables are stored in `.env.local`

## Important Notes

1. Database Reset:
   - Use `supabase db reset` to apply schema changes
   - Watch for migration errors, especially around view and policy creation

2. User Roles:
   - Super admin role is automatically created for the first user
   - All other roles need to be explicitly assigned

3. Brand Access:
   - Users need explicit access granted through `user_brand_access` table
   - Access levels: 'owner', 'admin', 'editor'
